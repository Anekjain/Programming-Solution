Problem:
Every Political Party has a hartal parameter = h,
There are no Hartals on either Friday or Saturday.
No of Days of Stimulation is nod
We should find no of No of working days lost in a nod.

Example:
Input - 
No of Stimulation days nod = 14
No of Political Parties nop = 3
Hartal parameter of Political Party h0 = 3
				    h1 = 4
				    h2 = 8
Output:
No of Days Lost in Hartal lost_days = 5	

NOTE : Hartal on Friday or Saturday is not counted.

Solution 1 [Algorithm]:
--------------------------
1. Using Dictionary [Hash Map] to stimulate days with
default value 0
2. Iterating Dictonary.keys
    if (keys mod hartal paratmeter == 0 and (keys != 6 and 7):
	value = 1
3.get lenght all values which equals 1 
	-> Working Days lost due to Hartal.
